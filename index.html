                    Welcome to Binghamton ACM! We are a computer science club
                    here on campus. We hold weekly workshops where members
                    present on interesting topics in Computer Science. Bing ACM
                    also holds coding competitions each semester with cash
                    prizes. If you are an aspiring Computer Scientist, a
                    programming hobbyist, or even just mildly interested in
                    computers, this is the club for you. Hope to see you at our
                    meetings!
