                    Welcome to Binghamton ACM! We are a computer science club
                    here on campus. We hold weekly workshops where members
                    present on interesting topics in Computer Science. Bing ACM
                    also holds coding competitions each semester with cash
                    prizes. If you are an aspiring Computer Scientist, a
                    programming hobbyist, or even just mildly interested in
                    computers, this is the club for you. Hope to see you at our
                    meetings!

                                Nick is a senior computer science major. He has
                                worked on many interesting projects like
                                designing games, such as deal or no deal, and he
                                enjoys playing sports like volleyball and
                                lacrosse. Outside of classses, you can often

                                interested in computer science, and it is a
